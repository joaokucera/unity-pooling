A generic game object pooling to unity 3d
=========================================

The proposal here was to create a simple generic pooling to be used in 2d unity projects.

Instead of creating and destroying new objects all the time, this script reduces garbage by pooling instances, allowing you to seemingly create hundreds of new objects while only actually using a recycled few.
